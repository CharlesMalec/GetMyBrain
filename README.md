An AI-powered tool to gather knowledge about business functions (e.g., "Manage a PPA") through a conversational large language model (LLM). The tool captures processes and operational activities, adapts to client feedback, accounts for local specificities (e.g., Germany, France, Netherlands), and generates a structured Markdown wiki.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The Knowledge-Gathering AI Tool enables users to document business functions via a dynamic Q&A interface. Starting with the question, "Which function shall we start with?", it builds a knowledge base by adapting questions based on user responses and incorporating local regulations. The output is a clean, structured Markdown wiki, ideal for process documentation and knowledge sharing.
